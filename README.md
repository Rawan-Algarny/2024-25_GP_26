## Introduction
The Smart Streetlighting project aims to transform urban lighting by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create a more efficient and sustainable system. As cities expand, traditional streetlights become increasingly inefficient and costly, prompting the need for innovative solutions. The primary goal of this project is to develop an intelligent street lighting system that significantly reduces energy consumption, enhances public safety, and lowers maintenance costs.The project aims to meet the critical need for smart city solutions by combining sensors with a centralized management platform, which will ultimately make urban areas safer and more sustainable.
