# ðŸŒŸ LUSTRA
## Welcome to LUSTRA 
Are you tired of outdated streetlights that waste energy and leave your neighborhood dimly lit? Then LUSTRA is the solution for you! Our innovative Smart Streetlighting project is here to transform urban lighting for a brighter, safer future. Imagine a city where streetlights adapt to real-time conditions, saving energy while enhancing safety for everyone.

## Introduction
LUSTRA is an intelligent street lighting system that reduces energy usage and maintenance costs by utilizing advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technology. With integrated sensors and a central management platform, our system ensures that lights are only on when needed, lighting up streets during peak hours and dimming when they're empty.This means safer streets for pedestrians and drivers alike, while also supporting sustainable urban development. Not only are we lighting up the streets with LUSTRA, but we're also clearing the path for smarter, more productive cities that put public safety first and enhance the quality of urban life. Support us to bring brightness to your community!
